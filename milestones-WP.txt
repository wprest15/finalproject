Rubric:
10 points - Research
20 points - Implementation of program
10 points - Debugging and presentation

Rough plan for the timetable of working on project:
- Research the idea for our project
   Idea right now: 2D platformer video game
- When current class projects are complete, commit a few hours per week to the project
- In late October, have a strong implementation of the programs
- Spend the remaining time debugging and testing for errors, then prepare for presentation
- Required time for each partner: about 20 hours for total project, but probably more for debugging
