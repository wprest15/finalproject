10 points - Research
20 points - Implementation of program
10 points - Debugging and presentation

Rough plan for the timetable of working on project:
- Research the idea for our project
   Idea right now: 2D platformer video game
- When current class projects are complete, commit a few hours per week to the project
- In late October, have a strong implementation of the programs
- Spend the remaining time debugging and testing for errors, then prepare for a presentation
- Required time for each partner: about 20 hours for total project, but probably more for debugging

For this project, we really want to assign tasks to each other while sharing the same programs so we can see the progress
and help each other when there is an issue with creating the project. A timetable will probably look like starting the work pretty early,
so we have plenty of time for debugging.
